# Bharat Intern Assignment 1: User Registration Form using MongoDB

Welcome to my Bharat Intern Assignment 1 repository! ðŸš€ In this assignment, I built a user registration form using MongoDB, Express.js, and Node.js. Here are the key details:

## Technologies Used
- MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing user information.
- Express.js: A web application framework for building the server.
- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime for server-side development.

## Features
- **User-Friendly Form:** A registration form with fields for username, email, and password.
- **Secure Storage:** User data is securely stored in a MongoDB database.
- **Seamless Communication:** Express.js facilitates smooth communication between the front-end and back-end.
- **Registration Handling:** Backend logic for processing registration requests and providing feedback messages.

## Achievements
- Implemented server-side validation for enhanced data integrity.
- Successfully established a connection between the application and MongoDB.
- Deployed the application on a local server for testing and verification.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Run the application with `node server.js`.

## Feedback
Feel free to explore the code and provide any feedback or suggestions. Your insights are greatly appreciated!

Happy coding! ðŸš€
